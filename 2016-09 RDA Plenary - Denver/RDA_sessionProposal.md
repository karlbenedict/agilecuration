# Title of Meeting: Planning meeting for Agile Data Curation Interest Group and Associated Working Group(s)

# Introduction

The conteptual model for Agile Data Curation and associated planning and development of presentations, working group meetings, working documents, and planned tasks has been under development since 2014, including two RDA BOF sessions (Plenary 5 and 6) in which a broader community of RDA members contributed to the development efforts. The Collection of materials related to this initiative can be found 
within the project's publicly accessible [Open Science Framework sharing site](https://osf.io/8mtn3/) and within the group's public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karlbenedict/agilecuration). Our growing bibliography of materials related to the development of our conceptual model can be found in our shared public [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/agile_data_curation). 

The objectives of the meeting are
* Review and revise a draft case statement for the formation of an *Agile Data Curation* Interest Group within RDA
* Identify additional Working groups that *may be formed* that relate to the spcific activities that have been identified thus far as likely tasks for participants in the Interest Group:
	* Community Outreach to Reach Consensus of the Values and Principles that Underlie a Concept of Agile Data Curation
	* Develop the capacity to capture and analyze case studies of intentional or coincidental agile data curation practices
	* Capture case studies to develop *agile data curation design patterns* that reflect exemplars of practices that are aligned with the values and principles of agile data curation. 

# Targeted audience and how to prepare for the meeting:

This is an open session to which data practitioners in multiple disciplines are invited to contribute to the planning and development of the interest group through 

* development of the interest group case statement - available [here](https://osf.io/8mtn3/wiki/Draft%20Agile%20Data%20Curation%20Case%20Statement/) for review prior to the meeting
* contribute to the community definition of values and principles that are reflected by the concept of agile data curation - available [here](https://osf.io/8mtn3/wiki/Draft%20Agile%20Data%20Curation%20Values%20and%20Principles/) for review prior to the meeting
* contribute to the refinement of the instrument that will be used to capture case studies to feed into the development of agile data curation design patterns - available [here](https://osf.io/8mtn3/wiki/Draft%20Agile%20Data%20Curation%20Case%20Study%20Survey%20Instrument/) for review prior to the meeting.
