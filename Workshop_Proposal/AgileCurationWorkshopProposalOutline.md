#DRAFT Proposal Outline for Agile Curation Workshop

##Project Summary

###Overview

Data curation traditionally follows a data life cycle approach with discretely defined steps. These steps are portrayed as sequential with some feedback loops. We argue that this approach has at its core a notion of a discrete object or collection of objects that are to be managed. 

We argue that a new conceptualization of data curation needs to be developed. We are arguing for more of a use-based notion of curation and one that incorporates new tools and new approaches to rethink the data life cycle curation. These tools and approaches are based on two principles: 1) Move the inclusion of data management and curation as early in the research process as possible, and 2) to not think of data as static, but something that is dynamic with an ongoing presence.

We propose a workshop to: 1) Bring together experts in relevant fields such as data curation, data science, library science, software carpentry, and data carpentry, 2) Systematically identify commonly understood barriers to effective data curation, 3) Explore the application of agile software development concepts and their applicability to data management, 4) Develop a case study framework, 5) Identify research issues, and 6) Propose next steps such as potential proposals, papers, or work in other forums such as RDA or EsIP.

[Can we cite a couple of examples that might help to demonstrate what we mean and how it's better?]

We believe the development and application of these concepts will have wide reaching impacts improving the accessibility and reusability of science data, improving the outputs of scientific research, contributing to scientific reproducibility, and reducing the overall costs of data curation.

###Intellectual Merit
Reusability of scientific data and reproducible science are directly connected to the ability to curate the data, to do the value-added work to generate metadata, documentation, and standardization. However, rising data volumes, the inclusion of software, the use of new tools and techniques, increasingly distributed collaboration, and limited resources inhibit the timely generation of requisite scientific data curation content.

More importantly, however, is that the widely adopted standard model for approaching data curation is data is created used for its original purpose and then handed to a repository or archive. When curation is considered for scientific data it is often at the end of the research process. That is when a scientist publishes their research, they may then decide or be required to deposit there data in an archive or repository. At that point, many questions are raised related to provenance and curational metadata that are much more difficult to answer at the end of the process.

###Broader Impacts
Bringing together a wide range of curation experts, data scientists, and data users will promote a dialog on what needs to change in order to provide the requisite curation capabilities for science in the age of the *Fourth Paradigm*. This conversation will have practical outcomes such as new ideas for best practices, and new approaches to more efficient use of available resources to promote the mutually suportive goals of curation and science. We will also be including representatives from HBUC as part of this effort and we will be including a cohort of young scientists and early career participants. These elements will help to provide potentially far reaching effects.

7. 
  
*Key Concepts for Discussion
*Key topics to be explored include [isn't this the same thing as key concepts?]



###Outcomes
1. Refince agile curation conceptual framework
2. Develop a case study framework
2. Collect a set of case studies
3. Workshop report
4. Publication
5. Ongoing community engagement [need to specify how...]
6. Propose other next steps such as potential proposals, training workshops, or additional work in other forums such as RDA or EsIP.

##Workshop Need and List of Topics

###Need
* Current curation is difficult to sustain. Threatens to be overwhelmed by increases in data volumes, complexities, sources
* Current data life cycle paradigm needs to be updated, doesn't reflect the way data is created, evolves, and is used
* These challenges negatively impact reusability, scientific productivity, increase curation costs, affect reproducibility

###Meeting Topics
* Why agile?
* What can we learn from agile development practices
* Refining the agile curation framework
* Identifying case studies / Case study collection
* Addressing education and training
* Community building around this approach
