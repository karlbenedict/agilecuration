## Abstract


## Introduction & Background

*Problem Statement*

The challenges and problems^[define - what are these?] with current research data^[define] curation^[define - as a complement to *management*] practices are commonly a product of ad-hoc^[define] or minimally designed^[define-perhaps in contrast with "engineered"] processes that are not explicitly developed to anticipate diverse needs^[define or illustrate - who and for what?] through a specific arc^[define as an alternative to *lifecycle*] of creation/acquisition, documentation, use, preservation and reuse *<cite>*. In response to this problem of under-design and with the increasing recognition of the value of research data as *products* of the research process that are critical elements for replication, validation and extension of research, a variety of requirements have been put in place by sponsors and publishers for planning for and executing effective data management^[define as a complement to *curation*] and sharing^[define] *<cite>*. While these requirements have resulted in more explicit documentation of *plans* for data curation and management, it remains unclear what impact they are having on *practice* *<cite>*. The set of values and principles developed by members of the software development community around the concept of *agile software development* provides a potential framework from which a set of agile data curation and management values and principles can be derived. Once a set of values and principles have been developed the community of research data producers and consumers is in a position to develop and use practices that are informed by those principles. 

The objective of this paper is to propose^[link to a web site where community input can be collected and collated into something like the *Manifesto*] a set of *agile data curation* values and principles that parallel those developed by members of the software development community, but reflect the distinctive characteristics and challenges posed by the research data process and its products. 

* Continuum from "Engineered" <==> "Agile" <==> "Ad-hoc"
	* Technical debt as another dimension for characterizing 
	* Dimensions to think about:
		* Required Formats
		* Required data schemas
		* Required file nameing conventions schemas
		* Required metadata/documentation content
		* Required metadata standards
		* Approvals required
* Recognize cost of capture/creation, management, sharing and preservation and build prioritization into decision making about what products/parameters are maintained within the system. 



*Background on **Agile Software Development** *

The processes used to develop computer software have evolved significantly since the early development of digital computing system and their applications in research and applications. The emergence of *agile software development principles* as outlined in the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* in 2001 set the stage for a recent thread in this development that focuses on

> *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

> *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

> *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

> *Responding to change* over following a plan (emphasis in original^[http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/index].

This set of principles emphasizes the importance of demonstrating value of developed capability through rapid and iterative development and release to users - delivering a product that provides incremental functionality that is defined and prioritized through frequent interaction with the users of the software. 



*Identified problems with the translation of agile software development principles into practice*

* Adoption of methods without parallel adoption of underlying values *<cite>*
* Failure to deliver products *<cite>*
* Underplanning *<cite>*



*Solving different problems*

* Agile software development principles came out of a reaction to the *over-engineering* of software projects in which there was an over-emphasys on documentation of requirements and strict development against those requirements over a long period of development, with little engagement with users and little flexibility once the process had started. This "waterfall" model produced many failed large-scale software development projects and the lightweight iterative process embodied in the values and principles of agile software development movement are a reaction to this approach. *Already had the engineering side, added agility*

* Agile data curation is an attempt to bring explicit design principles into a process that has historically consisted of ad-hoc or tacitly defined practices *while learning the lessons from software engineering* about the value of user engagement, delivery of value, iteration, design quality, and flexibility. In short - the development and adoption of a set of agile data curation principles can bring *just enough* structure into a process that has previously been minimally structured. *Already had agility, developing a higher degree of design/engineering*. 



*Current Research Data Management Practice*

* Data
* Metadata - documentation
* Sharing
* Preservation



*Technical Debt as a concept for characterizing the cost/risk of agile practices*

What is technical debt? ...

Data-related components of technical debt

* Inconsistently structured data
* Inconsistent content of data
* Data of unknown quality
* Insufficient metadata for:
	* Discovery
	* Understanding
	* Use
* Poorly structured sharing/access methods

## Literature

*Existing data management "best practice" recommendations

## Method

* *Proposed* Mapping of agile software development values and principles into appropriate corresponding values and principles for agile data curation
