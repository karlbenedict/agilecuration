* Maximize the impact of research data through accelerated capacity for discovery, access and use of valuable data
* Expect unanticipated needs for and uses of research data (and documentation) and develop flexible systems to support new uses and users without significant modifications
* Facilitate automated interaction with data and metadata assets through well documented public web services that enable disintermediated use and reuse of research data
* Data creators and data curators should work closely throughout planning, research and preservation activities to ensure the most efficient and streamlined process
* Identify key individuals in a data curation project that have the requisite knowledge and motivation to do the job and get out of their way
* Identify the most effective method(s) for maintaining close communication and <em>use</em> them
* Delivery, access, use and citation of research data are the primary measures of success
* Design principles that enable steady delivery of incremental improvements to research data discovery, access and use should be consistent with a sustainable level of effort and funding from sponsors, data creators and curators, and users
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
* Start with the basics and only make systems more complex as needed, while maintaining a low bar to entry
* Continuously work to develop and evolve a community of data providers, curators and users that all participate in the ongoing evolution of the research data systems that they interact with
